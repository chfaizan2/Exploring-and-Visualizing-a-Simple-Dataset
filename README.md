# Exploring-and-Visualizing-a-Simple-Dataset
## ○ The Task Objective

The objective of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions, relationships, and differences among iris species.

## ○ Your Approach

The dataset was loaded and cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and duplicate records. Various visualizations were created, including bar charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, pair plots, and a correlation heatmap, to analyze feature distributions and relationships across different iris species.

## ○ Results and Insights

The analysis revealed clear differences among iris species, especially in petal length and petal width, which showed strong separability. Scatter plots and pair plots highlighted strong relationships between petal features, while the heatmap confirmed high correlation between petal length and petal width. These insights indicate that petal features are highly effective for distinguishing iris species.
